# odin-recipes
The goal of this project is to make a website of favorite recipes showcasing a basic understanding of HTML concepts. The website should demonstrate mastery of the following concepts:
-HTML boiler plate
-image tags and their attributes
-anchor tags and their attributes
-creating a homepage that links to multiple pages
-headings
-paragraphs
-semantic HTML
-professional use of git commits
-debugging HTML

I am least confident in having professional commits. I have only ever added comments when pushing with the "-m" command, so I don't know how to make two line descriptions. I'm also unsure of how often to commit and push and what makes a professional vs an unprofessional commit. I will go back and reread the lesson and see if I can find any youtube videos explaining git commits.
